1.0 Introduction
----------------

  Finally, after almost one year of delay, I present my complete Atari Music
Archive. The reason for creation such a package was connected with ASMA achive.
Strictly speaking: I was satisfied neither of quality, neither of the number
of modules contained within ASMA package. So I decided to refresh and recreate
all modules, convert them to SAP format with more comprehensive description.
The most problematic thing was to find source files. Fortunately, in 1999 I
prepared two-disk archive with most of songs created in 1993-1999, so this
archive was the base of the music archive. I hope that the word "complete" is 
not meaningless. Seems that I was able to find almost all my modules (detailed
information one can find in section 2.0).

  I hope you enjoy it!
  
  Keep the Faith.

2.0 Archive Arrangement
-----------------------

GCMA directory tree is very simple. There are no subdirectories, and the
directory name is rather descriptives, so one can easily find what he/she
needs.

2.1 Music Collections
---------------------

[Second Music Collection (1994-1995)]
Released in the beginning of 1995, just before I joined Taquart. All
modules was used in the next collection, called "Big Ones", thus the
directory contains the executable file only. For now, I have no idea
why it is callec "Second Music Collection", cause I don't remember 
the first one...

[Big Ones (1995)]
Released in the beginning of 1995. It contained 9 modules I prepared
in 1994-1995 with Chaos Music Composer and its modyfication:
Doublespeed Chaos Music Composer (CMC, two times per frame). I planned to
prepare the second part of "Big Ones", but due to the new project, called
"Voice of Silence", I postponed the idea.

[Voice of Silence I (1995)]
Released in 1995. The first part from the well-known series, was created
in autumn'95 (probably...), after first (important) copy party in Orneta:
Quast Copy Party 1995. It contained my 8 modules created with Music
ProTracker - a brand new Music Tracker for 8 bit Atari designed by Adam
Bienias (aka Soused Teat/Slight, actually SoTe/Slight, the author of the
SAP Player). All modules use 15kHz samples and some new features like
modulation of the 2-channeled $0a distortion with another frequency table.
Some modules was created by Bac/Taquart.

[Voice of Silence II (1996)]
Released after QuaST (Orneta) Copy Party 1995, in the beginning of 1996. 
It contained some moduleswhich were created with Music ProTracker v2.4 
(the author of SAP Player!). Some modules was prepared by Bac/Taquart.

[Voice of Silence III - Eclipse Day (1997)]
After a long time, in 1997, I created the next music collection called
"Eclipse day". The main reason for such a delay was that I have started
studies. Nevertheless, the 1997 was quite fruitfull period - I participated 
in Rush Hours 1997 CP in Czêstochowa (organized by Shadows), where the 
intro "Really unreal" by Heaven was presented (with my music...), and in the
Intel Outside IV party in W³oc³awek, where Taquart has presented "Ultra". 
Music in "ULTRA" consisted of three modules created with TMC - a brand new
(then) tracker by Jaskier/Taquart. After Intel Outside, some other modules
were presented at Orneta 1997 CP. Whole this music staff was gathered in
Voice of Silence III. Unfortunately, there is a small bug in the main 
program, and sometimes the music plays wrong.

[Voice of Silence IV - Tribute To... (1998)]
This is definitely the worst collection from me. No graphics, no desing,
rather sad and dull songs. That's because I was a little bit depressed in
those days and months... Doesn't matter.

[Voice of Silence V - Cogito (1999)]
Released in the end of 1999. For me, this is the best music collection I
have ever made. Don't know why... Maybe because of a really good quality 
of modules. I really enjoy it. Some modules occured in the only one 
demo from me called "Cogito", which was presented at Last Party 1999. This
demo was dedicated to all people from atari scene which passed away.

[Voice of Silence VI - Expectancy]
This music collection was not included in this package. Mainly because it
is NOT a pure atari music collection. It was created with Atari 65XE and
Midi Sequencer (the forgotten program by mr Sygit). Atari was plugged with
my Casio CTK650 keyboard through midi port. Then, I dumped all modules to
regular WAV and MP3 files. If you want to listen to them, please visit my
homepage (see section 1.1).

2.2 Other projects
------------------

[Grayscale (2002-)]
This directory contains my own modules which were created during the 
Grayscale Music Project. For now, this is the only one interesting thing 
which I am involved in, with Xray and BeWu. Please, visit our official
website: http://grayscale.scene.pl for more details!


2.3 Other directories
---------------------

[Unsorted]
Contains subdirectories with modules created in different years, which 
weren't used in any production or project.

[Midi sequences]
From the beginning of 1997 I started creation of music with Midi Sequencer, 
not well known program by M. Sygit. This directory contains some modules 
I create since 1997 with this program. Unfortunately, the number of files
within the directory is definitely to small. It does not contain, for 
example, source files from "Voice of Silence VI - Expectancy" music 
collection. Of course, all files in this directory was not converted into
SAP format. Simply, it was NOT possible.

[Not converted]
This directory contains modules for which it was impossible for me to 
convert the source files into SAP format. If someone is able to convert
some of them into SAP, please, write to me!



3.0 Important issues
--------------------
This sections contain informations important for listeners.

3.1 ASMA archive
----------------
Greg's complete music archive was created partially based on informations
gathered in ASMA archive v2.9. "Informations", not "Files"! I do not used files
from ASMA archive. Moreover, my ASMA directory is NOT complete (compare the
number of modules! in ASMA and here), and some modules from ASMA have wrong 
names, some of them are corrupted a little bit. Thus, I encourage you to use
this archive in the exchange of my ASMA home directory. 

Below is the list of modules, which changed their names completely, 
according to other data sources.
